##It's going to be a cluster##

>I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree and climb black branches up a snow-white trunk toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more but dipped its top and set me down again. That would be good both going and coming back. One could do worse than be a swinger of branches.

**Snowball**
*I made myself a snowball
As perfect as could be.
I thought I’d keep it as a pet
And let it sleep with me.
I made it some pajamas
And a pillow for its head.
  Then last night it ran away,
  But first—it wet the bed.*
